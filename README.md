# dodecagon-computations (still in progress)
The following is a set of wrapper classes made in order to help perform symbolic computations related to the Kenyon-Smilie J-invariant.
Running main.py will produce a set of outputs which when taken together with the writeup (yet unfinished), will characterize Veech 12-gons with pi/3 rotational symmetry.

This code is written in SageMath, which is a language based on python.
